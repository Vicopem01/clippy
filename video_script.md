### **Scene 1: Introduction**

*   **Visual:** Start with a slow pan across `screenshot 1` (the GitHub page). Zoom in on the title "Clippy" and the tagline "A simple clipboard manager for macOS." Then, pan down to the "Features" section, highlighting each feature.
*   **Voiceover (Upbeat and friendly):** "Tired of losing things you've copied? Meet Clippy, the smart, simple clipboard manager for your Mac. Clippy keeps a running history of everything you copy, so you never have to worry about losing important information again."
*   **Text Overlay:** "Clippy: Your Clipboard History, Simplified."

### **Scene 2: Simple Installation**

*   **Visual:** Transition smoothly to `screenshot 2` (the installation view). Animate the "Clippy.app" icon lifting off the DMG window and flying into the "Applications" folder. Add a subtle sparkle effect when it lands.
*   **Voiceover:** "Getting started is as easy as drag and drop. No complicated setup, no fuss. Just drag Clippy into your Applications folder, and you're ready to go."
*   **Text Overlay:** "Effortless Installation"

### **Scene 3: A Fresh Start**

*   **Visual:** Fade into `screenshot 3` (the empty clipboard). Animate a cursor moving up to the menu bar and clicking the Clippy icon, which causes the empty history window to appear. The window can have a slight bounce effect as it appears.
*   **Voiceover:** "Clippy lives discreetly in your menu bar. The first time you open it, you'll see a clean slate, ready to catch everything you copy."
*   **Text Overlay:** "Always Accessible"

### **Scene 4: Clipboard in Action**

*   **Visual:** Morph `screenshot 3` into `screenshot 4` (the full clipboard). Animate text snippets and code blocks flying into the clipboard history one by one, filling it up. Animate the search bar typing out a query like "code snippet" and the list filtering in real-time. Finally, animate the cursor clicking on one of the items, which glows and then flies off-screen, simulating being copied.
*   **Voiceover:** "Watch as Clippy builds your history. Text, links, code â€“ it's all saved. Need to find something specific? Use the instant search. Found it? Just click to copy it right back to your clipboard. It's that simple."
*   **Text Overlay:** "Copy. Search. Reuse."

### **Scene 5: Outro**

*   **Visual:** End with a clean shot of the Clippy application icon in the center of the screen. Add the GitHub repository URL below it.
*   **Voiceover:** "Supercharge your workflow and bring order to your clipboard. Download Clippy today!"
*   **Text Overlay:** "Get Clippy on GitHub"
*   **Music:** Upbeat music swells and then fades out.
